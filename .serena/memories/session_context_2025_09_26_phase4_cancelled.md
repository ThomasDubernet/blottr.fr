# Session Context - September 26, 2025

## Session Summary

**Date**: September 26, 2025
**Duration**: Brief context loading and planning session
**Primary Action**: Project context loading with `/sc:load`
**Key Decision**: Phase 4 (Booking Platform) implementation cancelled by user

## Project Status Update

### Architecture Decision

- **Phase 4 Cancellation**: User explicitly decided not to implement the booking platform
- **Final Scope**: Project remains at 3-phase completion
- **Business Impact**: Platform focuses on artist discovery and portfolio showcase rather than booking

### Current Project State

- ✅ Phase 1: Authentication & User Management (29 tests passing)
- ✅ Phase 2: Business Domain - Artists & Salons (33 tests passing)
- ✅ Phase 3: Content System - Tags & Tattoos (36 tests passing)
- ❌ Phase 4: Booking Platform (CANCELLED - not implemented)

**Total Test Coverage**: 98/98 tests passing (100% success rate)

## Technical Architecture Final State

### Core Systems Implemented

1. **User Management**: Role-based authentication (client/artist)
2. **Geographic Foundation**: French cities with coordinates
3. **Business Core**: Salon and artist management
4. **Content System**: Tattoo portfolios with tags and metadata

### Database Schema Final

- **6 Core Tables**: users, cities, salons, artists, tattoos, tags
- **Pivot Tables**: artist_salons, tag_tattoos
- **Geographic Data**: Real French coordinates and INSEE codes
- **Content Management**: JSONB fields for flexible metadata

### Business Logic Complete

- **Artist Profiles**: Portfolio management with verification
- **Salon Management**: Multi-artist salon relationships
- **Content System**: Hierarchical tagging with engagement metrics
- **Geographic Search**: Distance-based salon/artist discovery

## Architectural Implications

### Platform Positioning

- **Focus**: Artist discovery and portfolio showcase platform
- **Scope**: NOT a booking/appointment system
- **Value Proposition**: Find artists, view portfolios, contact directly
- **Business Model**: Platform for artist visibility, not transaction processing

### Technical Debt Assessment

- **Minimal**: Clean architecture maintained throughout
- **Scalability**: Foundation supports growth in discovery features
- **Performance**: Optimized for read-heavy portfolio browsing
- **Maintenance**: Well-tested codebase with comprehensive coverage

## Future Development Opportunities

### Potential Enhancements (if needed)

1. **Enhanced Search**: Advanced portfolio filtering and recommendations
2. **Artist Tools**: Better portfolio management and analytics
3. **Social Features**: Reviews, favorites, artist following
4. **Content Enhancement**: Video portfolios, 3D tattoo previews

### NOT Planned

- Appointment scheduling system
- Payment processing integration
- Calendar management
- Client-artist booking workflows

## Session Recovery Context

### Project State

- **Git Status**: Clean working tree on main branch
