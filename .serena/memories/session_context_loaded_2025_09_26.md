# Session Context Loaded - September 26, 2025

## Project State Summary

### Current Status

**Project**: Blottr.fr - Tattoo booking platform
**Architecture**: AdonisJS 6 + React 19 + Inertia.js + PostgreSQL
**Git Branch**: main (clean working tree)
**Last Commit**: 702615c - "docs(session): complete Phase 3 session context and memory persistence"

### Development Progress

**Phase 1**: ✅ Authentication & Geographic Foundation (January 2025)

- Enhanced user system with role-based authentication (client/artist)
- French cities database with GPS coordinates and geographic search
- 29 comprehensive unit tests

**Phase 2**: ✅ Business Domain - Artists & Salons (January 2025)

- Artist profiles with specializations and portfolio management
- Salon management with multi-location support and verification
- Business relationship management and search capabilities
- 33 comprehensive unit tests

**Phase 3**: ✅ Content System - Tags & Tattoos (January 2025)

- Hierarchical tagging system with multi-language support
- Comprehensive tattoo content management with engagement tracking
- Advanced image management with variant generation and JSONB optimization
- 36 comprehensive unit tests

**Total Test Suite**: 98 tests implemented (69 passing, 29 failing due to FK constraint cleanup issue)

### Current Technical Issue

**Problem**: Foreign key constraint violations during test database cleanup
**Symptom**: `delete from "cities" violates foreign key constraint "salons_city_id_foreign"`
**Impact**: 29 tests failing due to setup/teardown issues, not business logic failures
**Root Cause**: Test cleanup order not respecting foreign key dependencies (salons → cities)

### Architecture Overview

#### Database Schema (10 tables)

1. **users** - Enhanced authentication with roles and geographic data
2. **cities** - French geographic database with GPS coordinates
3. **access_tokens** - API authentication support
4. **artists** - Artist profiles with specializations and portfolio data
5. **salons** - Business entities with verification and relationship management
6. **artist_salons** - Many-to-many relationship with employment metadata
7. **tattoos** - Content management with JSONB fields and engagement tracking
8. **tags** - Hierarchical categorization with translations and approval workflow
9. **tag_tattoos** - Advanced pivot table with relevance scoring and metadata
10. **schema_migrations** - Migration tracking

#### Models Architecture

- **Rich Domain Models**: Business logic encapsulated in model methods
- **JSONB Usage**: Complex metadata stored efficiently (image variants, translations, search keywords)
- **Relationship Management**: Proper foreign keys with cascade rules
- **Enum-Driven Design**: Strong typing for tattoo styles, body placements, statuses
- **Multi-language Support**: Translation interfaces and hierarchical content

#### Performance Optimizations

- **Strategic Indexing**: Composite indexes for common query patterns
- **Full-text Search**: PostgreSQL GIN indexes for search functionality
- **Engagement Metrics**: Calculated fields for sorting and filtering
- **Geographic Queries**: Optimized distance calculations and proximity search

### Technology Stack Details

- **Backend Framework**: AdonisJS 6 with TypeScript
- **Frontend**: React 19 with Inertia.js for SPA experience
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Lucid ORM
- **Testing**: Japa framework with comprehensive unit tests
- **Validation**: VineJS for form validation
- **Build Tools**: Vite with hot module replacement
- **Authentication**: Session-based with middleware support

### Quality Standards Achieved

- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage for all business logic
- **French Business Language**: Test descriptions in French for domain clarity
- **Production-Ready Code**: No mock objects, all actual database operations
- **Code Quality**: Zero ESLint errors, zero TypeScript warnings
- **Database Design**: Proper migrations with rollback procedures

### Memory Context Available

18 memory files with comprehensive project documentation:

- **Project Overview**: Technical stack and architecture summary
- **Implementation Summaries**: Detailed phase completion records
- **Session Checkpoints**: Development progress and technical decisions
- **Architectural Patterns**: Learned patterns and conventions
- **Testing Strategies**: Comprehensive testing approach documentation

### Immediate Action Items

1. **Fix Test Cleanup Issue**: Resolve foreign key constraint violations in test teardown
2. **Restore 100% Test Success**: Achieve full green test suite (currently 69/98 passing)
3. **Phase 4 Planning**: Booking system implementation (appointments/consultations)

### Development Readiness

- **Session Persistence**: All context loaded through Serena MCP integration
- **Memory Continuity**: Comprehensive documentation for seamless development
- **Architecture Foundation**: Solid base for Phase 4 booking system implementation
- **Quality Infrastructure**: Proven patterns for rapid, reliable development

### Next Session Priorities

1. Investigate and fix test database cleanup foreign key issues
2. Restore 100% test success rate (target: 98/98 tests passing)
3. Validate all business logic remains intact after fixes
4. Prepare for Phase 4 booking system implementation

**Session Status**: ✅ Context fully loaded, ready for immediate development continuation
