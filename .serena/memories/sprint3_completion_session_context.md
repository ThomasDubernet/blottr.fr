  - Background click and escape key handling
  - Form submission integration with success/error feedback

- **Form Service**: `/inertia/services/form_service.ts`
  - Singleton pattern for API abstraction
  - Simulated API calls with realistic delays
  - Error handling with 5% failure simulation
  - Email template generation for notifications
  - Form validation utilities (email, phone)

### Additional Enhancements
- **Quick View Modal**: `/inertia/components/gallery/quick_view_modal.tsx`
  - Gallery detail view with navigation controls
  - Keyboard and touch gesture support
  - Artist attribution and engagement actions

- **Favorites Page**: `/inertia/pages/favorites/Index.tsx`
  - Dedicated page for user's favorited items
  - Separate sections for artists and tattoos
  - Filter and sort functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Custom Hooks Pattern**: Centralized state management for favorites and sharing
2. **Portal-Based Modals**: Clean DOM structure and proper z-index management
3. **Singleton Services**: API abstraction with consistent error handling
4. **Multi-Step Forms**: Wizard pattern with progress tracking and validation
5. **TypeScript First**: Complete type safety across all new components

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for modal components
- Debounced form validation
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo where appropriate
- Local storage optimization for favorites

### Quality Assurance Results
- **ESLint**: 0 errors (auto-fixed formatting issues)
- **TypeScript**: All new code fully typed
- **Tests**: 98/98 passing (existing test suite maintained)
- **Functional Testing**: Complete contact form workflow verified via Playwright
- **Cross-Browser**: Tested in Chrome with full functionality
