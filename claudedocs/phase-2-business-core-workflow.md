## Critical Business Logic

### Business Rules Implementation

1. **Shop Ownership**: Only verified users can own shops
2. **Salon Management**: Shop owners can create/manage their salons
3. **Artist Association**: Artists can work at multiple salons
4. **Geographic Constraints**: All entities must have valid city associations
5. **Status Management**: Inactive entities don't appear in public searches

### Complex Queries Optimization

```typescript
// Most complex queries to optimize:
// 1. Artists near location with availability
// 2. Salons with specific services and artists
// 3. Shops with highest-rated artists
// 4. Multi-criteria search (location + style + availability)
```

## Quality Gates

### Phase 2 Completion Criteria

- ‚úÖ **Data Integrity**: All relationships work correctly
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Complex queries <300ms
- ‚úÖ **Business Logic**: All business rules enforced
- ‚úÖ **Search Functionality**: Geographic and text search working
- ‚úÖ **Role Integration**: Proper access control throughout

### Validation Checkpoints

1. **Week 4 End**: Architecture approved, migrations designed
2. **Week 5 End**: Core models working, basic CRUD complete
3. **Week 6 End**: Full API working, frontend integrated

## Risk Mitigation

### üî¥ Critical Risks

1. **Complex Relationships**: Artist-salon many-to-many complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing of relationship operations
   - **Rollback**: Ability to disable relationship features
2. **Performance Issues**: N+1 queries on complex searches
   - **Mitigation**: Eager loading strategy, query optimization
   - **Monitoring**: Performance benchmarks for all search operations

### üü° Medium Risks

1. **Business Logic Complexity**: Over-complicated business rules
   - **Mitigation**: Start with MVP rules, iterate based on usage
2. **Geographic Search Performance**: Location-based queries slowness
   - **Mitigation**: Proper geographic indexing, query optimization
