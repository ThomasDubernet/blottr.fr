## Critical Business Logic

### Appointment Management Rules
1. **Availability Validation**: Artists can only be booked during available hours
2. **Conflict Prevention**: No double-booking of artists or salon stations
3. **Lead Time Requirements**: Minimum advance notice for bookings
4. **Duration Management**: Service types have minimum/maximum durations
5. **Status Transitions**: Clear workflow from request to completion

### Contact Request Processing
```typescript
// Lead Scoring Algorithm:
- Tattoo complexity/size (higher score = larger pieces)
- Budget indication (realistic budget = higher priority)
- Timeline urgency (flexibility = higher score)
- Communication preference alignment
- Geographic proximity to available artists
```

### Calendar Optimization
```typescript
// Availability Calculation:
1. Base artist schedule ‚Üí Remove existing appointments
2. Apply salon operating hours ‚Üí Check station availability
3. Consider setup/cleanup time ‚Üí Buffer between appointments
4. Factor in artist preferences ‚Üí Optimal time slots
5. Generate available slots ‚Üí Return sorted by preference
```
