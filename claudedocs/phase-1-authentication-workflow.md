## Critical Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
```
Enhanced User Model → Role-based Middleware → Frontend Auth Components
      ↓                        ↓                         ↓
City Model Implementation → Location Services → Location UI Components
```

### External Dependencies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL optimization for geographic queries
- **Frontend**: React component library for location picker
- **Testing**: Enhanced Japa configuration for auth testing

## Quality Gates

### Phase 1 Completion Criteria
- ✅ **Migration Success**: Both migrations run successfully up/down
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: >95% on authentication logic
- ✅ **Performance**: Auth operations <100ms
- ✅ **Security**: Role system prevents unauthorized access
- ✅ **Integration**: Frontend components work with enhanced auth

### Validation Checkpoints
1. **Week 1 End**: Architecture approved, tests designed
2. **Week 2 End**: Core implementation complete, basic tests pass
3. **Week 3 End**: Full integration complete, all quality gates passed

## Risk Mitigation

### 🔴 Critical Risks
1. **Authentication Breaking**: Existing users can't log in
   - **Mitigation**: Backward compatibility testing, staged rollout
2. **Performance Regression**: New queries slow down auth
   - **Mitigation**: Query optimization, database indexing, benchmarking

### 🟡 Medium Risks
1. **Role System Complexity**: Over-engineering permissions
   - **Mitigation**: Start simple, iterate based on requirements
2. **Frontend Integration Delays**: UI components take longer than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Backend-first approach, mock frontend data

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback (< 1 hour)
1. **Database**: Rollback migrations to previous state
2. **Code**: Revert to pre-phase-1 commit
3. **Tests**: Run full regression suite
4. **Monitoring**: Verify system stability

### Partial Rollback (< 30 minutes)
- Rollback specific features while maintaining core functionality
- Disable role-based access, keep basic authentication
- Remove location services, maintain user system

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Migration Time**: <5 minutes for up/down
- **Test Suite Time**: <2 minutes for full auth suite
- **Code Coverage**: >95% on authentication logic
- **Performance**: No regression in auth response times

### Business Metrics
- **User Experience**: No authentication disruption
- **Feature Readiness**: Role system ready for Phase 2
- **Location Foundation**: City system ready for business entities

## Phase 1 → Phase 2 Handoff

### Deliverables for Phase 2
1. **Enhanced User Model**: With roles and location support
2. **City System**: Foundation for business location services
3. **Security Framework**: Role-based access control
4. **Test Foundation**: Comprehensive auth test suite

### Dependencies Resolved for Phase 2
- User authentication system can support artist/salon roles
- Location system ready for business entity geographic features
- Permission framework ready for business entity access control
